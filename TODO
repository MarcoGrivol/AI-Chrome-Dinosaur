  Selenium:

      `Runner.instance_.` controls most of the game
      ✔ How to start the game and play until it crashes @created(20-02-26 17:27) @done(20-02-27 09:31)
        The game starts with up arrow key
        The game can be stopped by executing the script `Runner.instance_.stop()`
        The game can be resumed by executing `Runner.instance_.play()`

        One code works on the notebook but stops after `Keys.ARROW_UP` on notebook.
        The easiest way seems to start the game manually and the run NN algorithm after the game crashes 
        for the first time

      This seems like a good option for the NN

        ☐ Obstacles @created(27-02-20 11:20)
          `Runner.instance_.horizon.obstacles` gets all  the objects on the screen
          `Runner.instance_.horizon.obstacles[0].xPos` gets the xPos of the first obstacle
        ☐ Trex X position @created(27-02-20 12:50)
          seems to be fixed at 50 the xInitialPos
          to get a better representation with beetween the dino width and the obstacle pos
